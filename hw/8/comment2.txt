Suvodeep compares the benefits of using and not using generalization in the data. The reason which he states for the generalization includes:
* Generality: Ability to make a prediction 
* Trust: Faith in the system and prediction
* Insight: Generate insights regarding the data
* Training: Train the novice Software engineers
* Tool development: Deploy tools to improve the quality of decision
I agree with most of the parts. Generalization plays a crucial role. It has some advantages. If we are predicting something, it should apply to most of the scenarios. This will help in building trust among the peers as well. The trust will help us to teach novice learners about the model as well. We can teach them about factors that are going to affect the model. He further identifies an issue that context matters. Many studies are going on in the field of AI which identifies the context of the conversation to make any prediction. It's true indeed. There can be a sequence of vents that may be related or not related and any further prediction can be made by understanding the context of the conversation. In this case, we will be considering the models. Models do have context and it has overfitting as an enemy. When we have a large number of projects, we are increasing the data which may lead to overfitting the model. When learning local models from many projects, there is a wide range of features used in the model. It is easier to learn lessons from a smaller range of features for predicting our results. But sometimes, there are some features which are not clear in a local project level, we will require globalization to understand the impact of several features.
